CPS vs Codensity vs Reflection without Remorse
==============================================

This repository contains [example code](./Main.hs) for a [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45334985/when-to-use-cps-vs-codensity-vs-reflection-without-remorse-in-haskell) about the difference between CPS vs codensity vs reflection without remorse in Haskell.

If you have [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) installed, the example code can be executed on the command line:

```sh
$ ./Main.hs
fooM:
(["7","4"],'1')

fooCPS:
(["7","4"],'1')

fooCodensity:
(["7","4"],'1')

fooRWR:
(["7","4"],'1')
```
